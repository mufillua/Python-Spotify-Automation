# Python-Spotify-Automation
A script that scrape all of my songs from Spotify, search them on YouTube, get the URL and then use the library to download the MP3.

Scraping Spotify Playlist: Use Spotify's API to fetch the list of songs from your playlist. You'll need to authenticate with Spotify and make requests to retrieve the track information.

Searching for Songs on YouTube: Use a web scraping library like BeautifulSoup or Scrapy to search for each song on YouTube. You can automate this process by constructing search queries based on the song title and artist obtained from Spotify.

Extracting YouTube Links: Once you have search results, extract the YouTube video links associated with each song.

Downloading YouTube Videos: Use a library like pytube to download the audio from each YouTube video in MP3 format. Make sure to handle errors gracefully, as some videos may not be available for download or may be restricted.

Organizing Downloaded Songs: Organize the downloaded MP3 files in a way that makes sense to you, such as creating folders based on the artist or playlist name.
